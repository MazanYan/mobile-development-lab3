## Difficulties
1. Difficulties with dynamic images import to make them be displayed in ```<ListItem />``` 
component. To resolve the issue I had to add ```index.ts``` file to make ```<Avatar />```
component correctly recognize data in prop ```source```
2. Small difficulties with ListItem props content. Needed to read the docs more carefully.
